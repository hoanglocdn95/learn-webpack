# learn-webpack
That's my first app with webpack which can run without error (lol).
First of all, you have to open Terminal and run ``npm install`` to install all packages
Then, type ``npm start`` to run it, and wait for the appearance of it.

In the next time, i will complete README with the instruction of how to initial React with webpack.
